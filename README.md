### How to use

Add the sketch files as libraries: https://www.sketch.com/docs/libraries/

Then simply color in your layers with the default color variables or later styles if using an older version of Sketch. When you edit a color variable it will automatically update the later style and components globally in your document.

Tailwind 3 Default Colors can be found here: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors 

### What are there components, later styles and color variables?

Some people like to insert a component and mask the layer to be able to update the color on a UI component, others like to change the layer style and now we have color variables. As time goes on we will remove the color components and then the layer styles.

Changing a color and exporting to Tailwind

You don't need to keep the default tailwind color pallets, you can very easily change all or some of the colors, or even add new ones, read more here: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors
